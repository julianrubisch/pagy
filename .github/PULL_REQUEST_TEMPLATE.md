> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pagy is imminently moving towards [v43](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy-pre).
> - Please make PRs to the `master-pre` branch (v43) unless you are fixing a bug on the `master` branch.
> - If the changes are portable between `master-pre` and `master` it would be ideal if two PRs were submitted.
> - Please create a [version 43 discussion](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/new?category=version-43) before starting a PR to ensure your work will be included.

> [!TIP]
> See also [Contributing](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
